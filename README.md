Определение дальтонизма. Тест Струпа.

> In psychology, the Stroop effect is the delay in reaction time between congruent and incongruent stimuli.

> The effect has been used to create a psychological test (the Stroop test) that is widely used in clinical practice and investigation.

> A basic task that demonstrates this effect occurs when there is a mismatch between the name of a color (e.g., "blue", "green", or "red") and the color it is printed on (i.e., the word "red" printed in blue ink instead of red ink). When asked to name the color of the word it takes longer and is more prone to errors when the color of the ink does not match the name of the color.

> The effect is named after John Ridley Stroop, who first published the effect in English in 1935.
